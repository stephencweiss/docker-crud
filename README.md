# README

This project is all about learning how to use Docker for a better development experience.

In pursuing this aim, I am experimenting with different technologies.

## Run The App

To run the app, in the root of the application, run:

```sh
% docker-compose up
```

Or, use a VS Code Dev container by selecting the `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container` option from the VS Code Command Pallette.

## Use the App

Once running, the express server is available on port `3000` while the NextJS app is on port `3002`.
